# Final Project Details
- For my project, I will be creating a portfolio for myself as an author. It will present books that I have written and offer the chance to purchase them. Users will be able to view a general synopsis of the books and their prices. There will be a filter option to search for books on the website.
- I think that this assignment will not only give me the opportunity to reflect on and strengthen my knowledge of learned concepts, but it will also help me lay the groundwork for the eventual website that I do in actuality want to make for myself. As an author, having a website that presents books and makes shopping reliable would be extremely beneficial for me!
- This has clear application for my future career. It will allow me to reflect on books that I'm working on, plan for the future, and improve my advertising skills. This will all be based off of my ability to design effective websites. My motivation is no longer to just "get a good grade" but to work hard because it could affect my future.
